# Bachelor Thesis "Attention based selection of Log Templates for Automatic Log Analysis"

As part of my bachelor thesis I extended the existing work of another master thesis to evaluate the feasibility Attention based selection of Log Templates for Automatic Log Analysis, using different log parsing algorithms like DRAIN and SPELL. A GRU Neural network was trained on log data to choose the best log parsing algorithm for the type of logs.
