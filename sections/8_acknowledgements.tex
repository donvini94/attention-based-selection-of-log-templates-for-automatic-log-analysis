\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:achnowledgements}
I would like to thank Prof. Klemens BÃ¶hm for giving me the opportunity to work on this interesting topic. \\

Special thanks have to go out to my supervisor Pawel Bielski. He taught me a lot about the research process, invested a lot of time in me and this project and pushed me to give my best. I think him for all the meetings, the valuable feedback on my presentations, his patience and tenacity.  \\


I also want to use this chance to thank my friends Jan, Max, Ismar and Yoki for their open ears and their support during all the years of studying at KIT. Without you guys the time at university would not have been half as fun.
